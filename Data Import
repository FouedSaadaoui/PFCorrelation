To import your data, ensure your CSV file is structured as follows: the first column should contain dates (e.g., labeled "Date"), and the first row should include the names of the assets (e.g., "Asset1", "Asset2"). Each subsequent row should list the date in the first column and the corresponding asset prices in the remaining columns. The provided code calculates and displays the correlation matrix (in numerical form) and generates the corresponding heatmap.
